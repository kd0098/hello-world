# hello-world
just another repository

Hello,
I am Kartik. I am an undergraduate student who likes to code. I am new to the version control thing and just exploring what it is about.
It looks good, many problems that I have faced during extending my programs or debugging, may be easily handled by the branching and
commit features of github. I look forward to use this in my future project.
